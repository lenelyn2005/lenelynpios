# TODO: Fix admin_teacher_assignments.php

## Issues to Fix:
1. **Wrong content**: Contains dashboard content instead of teacher assignment functionality
2. **Missing statistics**: References `$stats` variable which is not defined
3. **Wrong page title**: Shows "Admin Dashboard" instead of "Teacher Assignments"
4. **Wrong breadcrumb**: Shows "Dashboard / Overview" instead of "Dashboard / Teacher Assignments"
5. **Wrong sidebar call**: Uses `renderSidebar('admin', 'dashboard')` instead of `renderSidebar('admin', 'assignments')`
6. **Missing teacher assignment forms**: The actual teacher assignment functionality is at the top but the HTML shows dashboard content
7. **Missing proper structure**: Should follow the same pattern as admin_teachers.php and admin_subjects.php

## Implementation Plan:
- [x] Fix page title and breadcrumb to show "Teacher Assignments"
- [x] Fix sidebar call to use 'assignments' as active page
- [x] Add proper statistics for teacher assignments (total assignments, teachers with assignments, etc.)
- [x] Replace dashboard content with proper teacher assignment interface
- [x] Create forms for individual teacher-subject assignment
- [x] Create forms for bulk assignment by department/course
- [x] Create current assignments list with edit/delete options
- [x] Add proper modals for editing assignments
- [x] Fix any missing variables or undefined references
- [ ] Test the teacher assignment functionality
- [ ] Verify all forms work correctly
- [ ] Check that assignments are properly saved to database
- [ ] Ensure UI is consistent with other admin pages
